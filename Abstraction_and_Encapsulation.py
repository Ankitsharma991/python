Abstraction means breaking down a single things into many pieces and each piece performs different function and the over all functioning of the all pieces combined is known as layer of abstraction
for example a mouse, keyboard, monitor etc all are separate pieces with different function of their own and combinely known as computer which works as a layer of abstraction

For Abstraction we need to Encapsulate things , for eg, to perform the action of mouse in a computer we need to join the mouse with the computer or need to maintain some other systems and settings
Encapsulation means to hide the implementation of any things to avoid confusion to anyone
